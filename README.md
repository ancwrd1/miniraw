## MiniRAW NG - print job listener written in Rust

This application is inspired by old "miniraw" utility written by Rocco Lapadula.<br/>
Compared to the original version mine is:
* Open source
* Written in modern language
* Doesn't suffer from occasional issues with premature socket shutdown

This is a GUI utility currently working on Windows. Will support other frameworks later.<br/>
Binary releases can be downloaded from Releases section.
